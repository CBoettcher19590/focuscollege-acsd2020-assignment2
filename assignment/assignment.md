# Getting Started

  * Create a FORK of this repository. You will find the "FORK" button in the top right hand of any accessible repository. You want to FORK this repository to your github account.

     > <br/>If you would like a crash course on FORKING, here is a simple video (2m 29s): [Forking a GitHub Repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5grYMXbAV0)<br/><br/>

  * Create a CLONE of the FORKED repository on your local machine.

    > <br/>Take care not to clone inside another project folder!<br/><br/>

  * Create a BRANCH called `development`.

  * CHECKOUT the `development` branch. This will be your working branch to commit and push for this assignment.

<br/>

# Submission

  * To submit your assignment, push your `development` branch to GITHUB and then create a pull request into the `master` branch using GITHUB.

  * You may push your code to the `development` branch as many times as you like. This is good practice to do this at least once a day if you have any changes.
