# Program Requirements
  
  * Accept Parameters on the command line to be used by the      application.

    > The actual command line parameters are already coded for you in this assignment, but you need to use them

  * Calculate the total number of 2x4's required for the house

  * Calculate the total number of 4x4's required for the house

  * Update the rounding as per your suggestion in the email to Gerald

  * The logic that calculates the boards and beams should be seperated into its own module and not directly in the parameter logic. You may use additional modules if you like, but only the one is required.

  * Replace the readme.md file with instructions for Gerald describing how to use your application. Gerald already has node, npm and git on his computer.
